this is a php-gtk based program to easilly run gource repository virtulization

why i used php-gtk you ask? well, first of all just to try this out, i'm a php web developer, and
php is my main language of use. i have never wrote any gtk applications. and found out that i can use
my php skills to do so. i'm not use how many of you can run php-gtk, since php-gtk v2.0 is still new
so you can check docs here: http://gtk.php.net
and you can also port this to C++ or something, but i will be really happy if php coders will join me and build this tool
so we all can get good and fast results from Gource (http://code.google.com/p/gource/)
